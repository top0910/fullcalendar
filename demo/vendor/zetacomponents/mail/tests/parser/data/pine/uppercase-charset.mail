That's all right. Everybody makes mistakes :-) I probably could add this 
to Xdebug quite easily, but the thing is, the protocol specs don't 
support it (yet) and neither of course will IDEs. If you can get 
netbeans people willing to commit to adding Windows pipe support as 
well, then I'll have a look at getting Xdebug to support it.
